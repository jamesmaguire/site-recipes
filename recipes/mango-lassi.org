Serves 2

* Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups frozen mango
- 4 generous tbsp of coconut yogurt
- 1 1/2 cup oat milk
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon

* Method
  1. Add to blender
  2. Blend
  3. Add some additional oat milk to reach desired consistency

* Notes
- Use tasty mango. We use "Creative Gourmet". The generic coles/woolies brands don't have a good mango flavour.
- Tastes good with "Nakula" coyo. Haven't tried any others yet
