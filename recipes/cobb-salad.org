* Method
1. Begin by whisking all of the dressing ingredients together in a small bowl or jar. Allow it to sit while you prepare the rest of the salad.
2. To make the eggy tofu, first stir the turmeric, garlic powder, kala namak and pepper together in a small bowl.
3. Coat the bottom of a medium skillet with olive oil and place it over medium heat.
4. When the oil is hot, add the tofu and cook for about 10 minutes, flipping once or twice to achieve browning on multiple sides.
5. Sprinkle the tofu with the lemon juice and flip a few times to coat.
6. Sprinkle the turmeric mixture over the tofu and toss a few times to coat.
7. Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the tofu to a plate.
8. Fill a large salad bowl with the lettuce (or divide it among 4 individual bowls).
9. Arrange the toppings over the lettuce, then sprinkle with salt, pepper and chives.
10. Drizzle with dressing and serve.
